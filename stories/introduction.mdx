# CIE 1931 Color Space Diagram

The CIE 1931 color space, also known as the CIE XYZ color space, is a fundamental model for representing colors based on human perception. Developed by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) in 1931, it maps all visible colors within a horseshoe-shaped diagram, often referred to as the chromaticity diagram. This diagram represents:

- **Chromaticity**: The x and y coordinates on the diagram correspond to the color's hue and saturation, independent of brightness.
- **Color Gamut**: The outer boundary shows the purest, most saturated colors (monochromatic light), while the interior represents mixed or less saturated colors.
- **White Point**: The central area approximates neutral or white light.

This React component, `react-cie-1931`, renders an interactive version of the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram with WebGL-accelerated rendering, allowing users to visualize color spaces, zoom and pan, and explore color relationships. It features smooth performance and accurate color representation, making it ideal for color science, design, and digital imaging applications.

## Installation

To use the `react-cie-1931` component in your React project, follow these steps:

1. **Install the package** via npm or pnpm:
   ```bash
   npm install react-cie-1931
   # or
   pnpm add react-cie-1931
   ```

2. **Import the component** into your React application:
   ```jsx
   import { ChromaticityDiagram } from 'react-cie-1931';
   ```

3. **Use the component** in your JSX:
   ```jsx
   <ChromaticityDiagram />
   ```

## Basic Usage

The `ChromaticityDiagram` component renders an interactive CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram with zoom and pan capabilities. You can customize its appearance and behavior with various props:

```jsx
<ChromaticityDiagram
  colorSpaces={[
    {
      name: "sRGB",
      primaries: { r: [0.64, 0.33], g: [0.3, 0.6], b: [0.15, 0.06] },
      whitepoint: [0.3127, 0.329],
      color: "rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)"
    },
    {
      name: "Display P3",
      primaries: { r: [0.708, 0.292], g: [0.17, 0.797], b: [0.131, 0.046] },
      whitepoint: [0.3127, 0.329],
      color: "rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.8)"
    }
  ]}
  showPlanckianLocus={true}
  colorSpace="display-p3"
  axisLabelColor="#333"
  gridLineColor="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)"
/>
```

## Features
